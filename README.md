# LaProwFX

**LaProwFX** is a personal **all-in-one Camera RAW–style shader** for ReShade.  
It’s not optimized and not meant to be perfect, just a convenient way to gather all the editing controls I want in one place, without having to chain multiple FX.

## ✨ Features
- **Basic Adjustments**: Exposure, Contrast, Saturation, Vibrance  
- **Color Controls**: Temperature, Tint, Hue Shift, Highlight/Shadow tweaks  
- **LUT Support**: Load your own LUTs with adjustable blending  
- **Tone Tools**: Clarity, whites/blacks  
- **And more**: I add things whenever I feel like it

## ⚠️ Notes
- Built for **personal use**  
- **Unoptimized** → expect performance hits on lower-end PCs  
- Will update it... *or maybe not*
